## Results
Generally for random the propability of picking a number from an iteratble is same for every element.

But in case of numpy.random.poisson() the propability of picking a number follows poission distribution
Similarly, numpy.random.normal() the propability of picking a number follows normal distribution

The average of the part of above that is random taken subset will still provide the actual mean with a very little uncertanity.
